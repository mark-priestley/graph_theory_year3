# Applying graph theory to model students applying for college courses

For this project, I used neo4j and python to model what would happen if students in a university could change courses based on the "similarity" between their current course and the course they want to switch to.

"final_results.pdf" explains the full process and how I got my results.

The repo also contains the cypher queries used in neo4j, as well as the python code in a jupyter notebook
